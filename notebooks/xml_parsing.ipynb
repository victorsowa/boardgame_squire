Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&amp;ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&amp;#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&amp;#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&amp;#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

In the early 1990's, the rights to the game reverted to the original publisher for some reason, but the rights to the name Alfapet stayed with BRIO.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BRIO had purchased Alga some 10 years before and had made them BRIO's board game arm, phasing out the old board game brand Joker who had been used for all the Scrabble-Alfapets over the year. So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear's (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel (all subsequent editions in Swedish) started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name. It might be interesting to note that Joker's last Alfapet (of Scrabble type) and Spear's first was virtually identical to each other, save some names and logotypes.&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Joker's last edition of Scrabble&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;  &amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Spear's first and only edition&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9; &amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Alga's first edition of &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; Alfapet&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The name Alfapet was much more known, so this game sold better (most people who had heard of &amp;quot;Scrabble&amp;quot; thought it to be the English version of &amp;quot;Alfapet&amp;quot;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To a large extent, Alfapet and Scrabble are very similar games. The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition. The only known difference in this limited edition is that it has a new dark design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Scrabble&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&amp;mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Ragnar&amp;ouml;k has come, and it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world! It&amp;rsquo;s the Vikings&amp;rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&amp;rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&amp;ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &amp;ldquo;Gods&amp;rsquo; Gifts&amp;rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&amp;rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

This clan comes complete with 8 Warrior figures (in two different sculpts), 1 Leader Figure, 1 Ship figure, 1 Clan Sheet, 1 Plastic Glory Marker, 4 cardboard Clan tokens, 11 small colored bases, and 2 large colored bases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This expansion introduces the option of playing Blood Rage with 5 players. The game board supports this by simply not having any province destroyed by Ragnar&amp;ouml;k before the beginning of the game. However, more players need more cards, so this expansion box comes with 24 &amp;quot;Gods' Gifts&amp;quot; cards (8 for each Age deck). All of these cards have the &amp;quot;5+&amp;quot; players pre-requisite listed on them. While most of them are extra copies of cards from the base game, there are a few new ones, like the &amp;quot;Widespread!&amp;quot; Quest, where you need to dominate any 2 provinces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Randomly draw two god cards and place them next to the board so all players can see their powers. At the end of the initial setup, shuffle the Ragnar&amp;ouml;k tokens that are not on the board or on the Age Track and draw two of them. Look at the names of the two provinces listed on the tokens and place one god figure in each of them (these Ragnar&amp;ouml;k tokens are then put aside).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each god's ability is always in effect, changing the rules of the province they're in. The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnar&amp;ouml;k tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will you try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans. They add a whole new layer to the game, without adding hardly any complexity to the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The miniatures each come with a tarot-sized God card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&amp;#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&amp;#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&amp;#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&amp;#10;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &amp;mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<description>Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Beschreibung&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St&amp;auml;dten und Kl&amp;ouml;stern, Stra&amp;szlig;en und Wiesen. Mit Taktik und ihren Gefolgsleuten (Meeple) dehnen die Spieler in diesem raffinierten Legespiel ihren Einfluss auf die einzelnen Bereiche st&amp;auml;ndig aus. Und das mit wachsender Begeisterung!&amp;#10;Carcassonne ist ein Legespiel, bei dem die Spieler verdeckt Landschaftspl&amp;auml;ttchen ziehen und an die bestehende Landschaft passend anlegen m&amp;uuml;ssen. Auf den Pl&amp;auml;ttchen sind St&amp;auml;dte, Stra&amp;szlig;en, Kl&amp;ouml;ster und Grasland in verschiedenen Kombinationen dargestellt. Wenn dann das Pl&amp;auml;ttchen passend angelegt wurde, darf der Spieler entscheiden, ob auf das gerade angelegte Pl&amp;auml;ttchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt), Wegelagerer (auf Stra&amp;szlig;e), M&amp;ouml;nch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll, vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Tower segments are added to the game, as well as some new actions.  Instead of placing a Meeple as usual on their turns, players can now either place a tower segment on a tile with a space for a tower, add a tower segment to a tower already standing, or place a Meeple on top of a tower (which &amp;quot;finishes&amp;quot; it).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Placing a tower segment allows you to capture other players' Meeples, so long as they are in view of the tower in an orthogonal direction.  If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<description>In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Catan Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game requires The Settlers of Catan.  Ideally, using the same publisher and edition of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns as follows:&amp;#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Make &amp;quot;variable&amp;quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &amp;quot;get rid of&amp;quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &amp;quot;uninvited&amp;quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &amp;quot;getting rid of&amp;quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &amp;quot;called&amp;quot;) can also be played in this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &amp;quot;Whenever&amp;quot; cards which can be played at any time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&amp;uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

They are code for locations where spies must contact secret agents!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two rival spymasters know the agent in each location. They deliver coded messages telling their field operatives where to go for clandestine meetings. Operatives must be clever. A decoding mistake could lead to an unpleasant encounter with an enemy agent &amp;ndash; or worse, with the assassin! Both teams race to contact all their agents, but only one team can win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Codenames: Pictures differs from the original Codenames in that the agents are no longer represented by a single word, but by an image that contains multiple elements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Cosmic Encounter, each player becomes the leader of one of dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. Both sides can invite allies and play cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory. And, because alliances are a key part of the game, multiple players can win together!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &amp;quot;pig&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;candy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tent&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;son&amp;quot;, then I might say &amp;quot;Sam-striped-pink&amp;quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &amp;quot;sucker-prince-stake&amp;quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you'll need every advantage you can take...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Compared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Simpler rules for determining line of sight &amp;#10;     Faster setup of each encounter&amp;#10;     Defense dice to mitigate the tendency to &amp;quot;math out&amp;quot; attacks&amp;#10;     Shorter quests with plenty of natural stopping points&amp;#10;     Cards that list necessary statistics, conditions, and effects&amp;#10;     A new mechanism for controlling the overlord powers&amp;#10;     Enhanced hero selection and creation process&amp;#10;     Experience system to allow for hero growth and development&amp;#10;     Out-of-the-box campaign system&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Descent 1st edition Conversion Kit &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Conversion Kit&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&amp;mdash;leading to immense variety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Dominion series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The players enter the unexplored Dragon's Keep in search for treasure. The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    DungeonQuest&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&amp;rsquo;s DUNE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &amp;ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&amp;rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

You take on the role of a hero who sets out to explore Dragonfire Dungeon and claim more treasure than your rivals. Along the way, you'll need to evade traps, battle monsters, and find your way through the labyrinthian dungeon, all while trying to avoid waking the dragon who sleeps atop the treasure heap at the dungeon's heart. The player who gathers the most loot &amp;ndash; and makes it out of the dungeon alive &amp;mdash; is victorious!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This new edition of DungeonQuest features a streamlined combat system that harkens back to the classic editions of the game, and a deadlier dungeon than ever before. The &amp;quot;Torchlight&amp;quot; variant offers you a new way to explore the dungeon's depths, while building an even more complex and sprawling dungeon throughout the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

After the ruthless Terran&amp;ndash;Hegemony War (30.027&amp;ndash;33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable &amp;ndash; only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships with which to wage war. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. Lead your people to victory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

In Epic, you take on the role of an elder god, in conflict with other elder gods. The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm.   In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &amp;ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &amp;mdash; you don&amp;rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; champions. One box supports preconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &amp;quot;cube&amp;quot; environment for drafting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &amp;mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&amp;#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back? Can you time your move perfectly?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Anyone can race, few become champions!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced, tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls a team of two riders: a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. The players&amp;rsquo; goal is to be the first to cross the finish line with one of their riders. Players move their riders forward by drawing and playing cards from that riders specific deck, depleting it as they go. Use slipstreams to avoid exhaustion and position your team for a well timed sprint for the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &amp;mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &amp;mdash; or they will do the same to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources&amp;#10;     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities&amp;#10;     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units&amp;#10;     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<description>Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&amp;#195;&amp;#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &amp;#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&amp;rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&amp;rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &amp;quot;Dashboard&amp;quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&amp;rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &amp;quot;Fuel&amp;quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&amp;#195;&amp;#169; Mini), and a lot of &amp;quot;after market&amp;quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&amp;#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

They can command the creation and destruction of continents and the rise and fall of civilizations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As gods, players seek to gain followers among the civilizations. They offer those followers luxuries, and oversee the building of pyramids and temples on their continents. In the end, the god with the most loyal, wealthy, and powerful followers will become ruler of gods, and wins the game...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play involves placing triangular tiles to form islands, coastlines and continents. Players can also replace tiles to reform the topography of the planet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each civilization is represented by a color, and once a civilization is &amp;ldquo;born&amp;rdquo; a player can gain worshipers in that civilization, which in turn may score points for that player in various ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The placement or replacement of tiles may result in civilizations migrating, or going to war with other civilizations. These things are resolved by the various icons on the tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is fairly simple, but offers quite a lot of tactical possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The game includes four new characters &amp;mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &amp;mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &amp;mdash; i.e., learning the game &amp;mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the &amp;quot;Great Western Trail&amp;quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first edition of Great Western Trail was released with a player count of 2-4, with some people making solo rules on their own, while the second edition will include solitaire rules, making for a player count of 1-4.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hannibal was designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. Hannibal has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com&amp;rsquo;s Wargame rankings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz. The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It has received new artwork. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure. These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be available as a separate products. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the Hannibal map on one side and the Hamilcar map on the other).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world&amp;rsquo;s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The base game of Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving. Hive Carbon and Hive Pocket include the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions, for a total of 26 pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The first player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &amp;quot;megabucks&amp;quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&amp;#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&amp;#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-published as:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Illuminati&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CCG Version:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magazine Articles:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&amp;#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&amp;#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&amp;#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Are we controlled by what we hear and what we see, even while thinking we decide freely? Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the &amp;quot;insider&amp;quot; who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &amp;quot;insider&amp;quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &amp;quot;commons&amp;quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider. If they guess correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Several years have passed since the island was afflicted by unrest and attempted putsches. Since then, the army has lost importance; in its place, private militias do the dirty work. The members of the Junta live a reclusive life in grandiose estates financed by their Swiss bank accounts. The players belong to this Junta and now command their own private militias. And, as before, they rob their opponents unscrupulously and ambush the president as often as they can in order to become president themselves. The players must pocket as much development aid as possible, use this to hire new militias and extend their estates. The player who does this the fastest wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Contents:&amp;#10;- 5 Estates (in 5 player colours)&amp;#10;- 20 dice (in 5 player colours)&amp;#10;- 45 cards&amp;#10;- 5 summary cards&amp;#10;- 5 player screens&amp;#10;- 25 building tiles&amp;#10;- 1 pair of presidential glasses&amp;#10;- 1 set of rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Source: publisher blurb on www.spiel-check.de translated from the German (see: http://www.spiele-check.de/9712-Junta_Viva_el_Presidente.html)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<description>From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen&amp;mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet&amp;rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them&amp;mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &amp;AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &amp;quot;Sanctum&amp;quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival&amp;rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &amp;AElig;mber to your pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &amp;mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &amp;AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &amp;AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &amp;AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Maybe he killed your pet rock. Whatever the reason, you want him dead. Unfortunately, so do the other players. Since you don't want to go to jail, you need to make your attempt in secret; if anybody can see you, whistle nonchalantly, and let the Doctor live ... until next time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players move around the mansion, collecting murder weapons (to make the murder attempt stronger - doubly so if the weapon is used in an appropriate location); failure cards (to thwart opponents' plans); and movement cards (to try to get together with Doctor Lucky in a secluded location for his inevitable demise.) Players try to convince others to use up their failure cards first, the better for when their own attempts come.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First Game in the King of Tokyo series&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Domino by domino, fill in your map while entrusting the territories of your kingdom to loyal dignitaries. Gather favors from wizards in order to cast powerful spells that will allow you to rule without having to share.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kingdomino Duel is a standalone game that preserves the essence of the acclaimed original Kingdomino. In this game, instead of adding dominoes to your kingdom, you will choose two dice to combine into a single &amp;quot;domino&amp;quot; that must then be drawn into your kingdom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&amp;oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &amp;mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &amp;mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001. The Limited Edition has a silver 22 carat gold plated ring, pewter Hobbit playing pieces, and a signed and numbered John Howe print. Box signed by Reiner Knizia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&amp;mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &amp;quot;the stack,&amp;quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Admit it. You love it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Other&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&amp;eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &amp;quot;big announcement.&amp;quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Sequels:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&amp;#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&amp;#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&amp;#10;    Munchkin Bites!&amp;#10;    Munchkin Booty&amp;#10;    Munchkin Conan&amp;#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&amp;#10;    Munchkin Fu&amp;#10;    Munchkin Impossible&amp;#10;    Munchkin Legends&amp;#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&amp;#10;    Munchkin Zombies&amp;#10;    Star Munchkin&amp;#10;    Super Munchkin&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Related Board Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Munchkin Quest&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Online play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Created by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic... 112 more cards for the game of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Play a new race: Orcs! Face foes like the Hydrant and the Tentacle Demons. Equip yourself with dread armor like the Spiked Codpiece. Recruit allies like the Shoulder Dragon. Wield mighty weapons like Druid Fluid, the Catapult and, of course, the dread Unnatural Axe... and show them who's the greatest munchkin of all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Munchkin 2 - Unnatural Axe is a supplement to Munchkin; you will need the original game to play. Or you could add it to a game of Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, or Munchkin Bites! instead, or mix them all together for a Munchkin-fest of truly mind-bending proportions!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Other&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A rare poster-magazine called &amp;quot;Sinkadus&amp;quot; 41# &amp;amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Orl&amp;eacute;ans, you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; spread of the infections.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Pandemic series&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For three generations, we, the last fragments of humanity have lived on the seas, on floating stations called &amp;quot;havens.&amp;quot; Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We've managed to keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off our grid...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tomorrow, a small group of us head out into what's left of the world. We don't know what we'll find.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 is an epic cooperative game for 2 to 4 players. Unlike most other games, this one is working against you. What's more, some of the actions you take in Pandemic Legacy will carry over to future games. No two worlds will ever be alike!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice. Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    All numbers in a row must increase from left to right.&amp;#10;    No number can be repeated in a vertical column.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows. Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon. For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row. For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row. For each misthrow, a player loses five points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&amp;rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rule Correction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &amp;quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&amp;quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &amp;ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &amp;ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal. You will build a shelter, palisade, weapons, you will create tools like axes, knives, sacks, you will do everything you can to&amp;hellip; to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who&amp;rsquo;s stuck on rock island&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let the adventure live!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &amp;quot;registers&amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&amp;rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Meanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The capitalistic city-state known simply as &amp;ldquo;The Factory&amp;rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&amp;rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &amp;ldquo;encounter&amp;rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The economy is robust, morale is high, and defenses are strong. There are reports from the countryside of strange soldiers with glowing eyes, but they seem distant and harmless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scythe: The Rise of Fenris, the conclusion to the Scythe expansion trilogy, enables two different options for any player count (1-5 if you have Scythe; 1-7 players if you have Invaders from Afar):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Campaign (8 games): The story of Scythe continues and concludes with an eight-episode campaign. While the campaign includes surprises, unlocks, and persistent elements, it is fully resettable and replayable.&amp;#10;     Modular (11 modules): Instead of&amp;mdash;or after&amp;mdash;the campaign, the new modules in The Rise of Fenris can be used in various combinations to cater to player preferences. These modules are compatible with all Scythe expansions, and they include a fully cooperative module.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the exact nature of the episodes and modules will remain a mystery (most of these components are in 5 secret tuckboxes and on 6 punchboards), the components in this expansion include a detailed episodic guidebook, 13 plastic miniatures, 62 wooden tokens, 2 custom dice, 25 tiles, and 100+ cardboard tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Most of it is entirely legal, however, Prince John is looking to make sure no contraband gets sold. He&amp;rsquo;s tasked the Sheriff to inspect Merchant&amp;rsquo;s wares, looking for any illicit goods. The Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s shrewd, but not above taking a bribe to look the other way. Which Merchant will end up getting the best goods through and make the largest profits in the market stalls?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham 2nd Edition, players take turns playing the Sheriff, looking for contraband goods, and the Merchants trying to stock their Stall with the best goods. The Sheriff can inspect any bag they want, but they must be careful, as they&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay a penalty if they find the Merchants were telling the truth. This new edition includes updated rules, as well as expansions such as the 6th Merchant, Black Market, and Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Deputies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game box contains 110 Gold Coins, 216 Goods cards, 6 Deputy cards, 6 Black Market cards, 2 Deputy standees, 6 Merchant stands, 6 Merchant bags, a Sheriff standee, a Booty tile, and a rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&amp;rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Monkey Business&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&amp;mdash;all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&amp;mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&amp;mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&amp;#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

We think you may be able to help us.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;     &amp;ndash;Mon Mothma&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New leaders. New missions. New tactic cards that lead to more fully cinematic combats&amp;hellip; Rise of the Empire is an expansion for Star Wars: Rebellion inspired largely by the movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And just as the movie provided new insight into the Galactic Civil War presented in the original Star Wars trilogy, Rise of the Empire adds new depth and story to your Rebellion game experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can send Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor to recover the Death Star plans. You can confuse Imperials with false orders and assaults behind enemy lines. You can command Director Krennic and his finest death troopers. And you can set traps for the Rebel pilots and soldiers, luring them away from their base and into massive battles with more fully cinematic combat and tactics. Even Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, offering his services to the Empire and feeding his prisoners to the Sarlaac.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Altogether, Rise of the Empire introduces eight new leaders, thirty-six plastic miniatures, five target markers, two attachment rings, three new dice, and more than one-hundred new cards. You'll find U-wings, TIE Strikers, Nebulon-B frigates, and the Interdictor. You'll gain new ways of subverting your opponent's plans, and you'll discover a whole new chapter in your ongoing Galactic Civil War!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

To attain this lofty position, players must leave Terra and the known planets to explore and colonize the galaxy, while working to establish trade with alien cultures, encounter aliens, and defeat pirates. Glory and victory go to the brave and astute explorer upon whom luck smiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The known worlds lie at one end of the game board, where each of the 3 or 4 players begins from known solar systems, each with 3 planets producing raw materials needed for the travels into deep space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player begins with 2 Colonies and a Space Port (all components are made from plastic). The Space Port makes starships to transport your new colonies and trade posts to distant lands. Throughout the game, all the colonies and spaceports enable the production of resources when the dice match the numbers of adjacent planets. Resources are traded for colony ships, trade ships, and fleet upgrades of freight rings, booster rockets, and cannon. Beware as you explore&amp;mdash;some planets are covered in ice, and some conceal dangerous pirates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &amp;quot;decksploration&amp;quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&amp;rsquo;s obstacles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &amp;mdash; Asylum &amp;mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Official FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Expansions were published in this order:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#147; Endurance (2017) &amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)&amp;#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Witness the glory and the twilight of the powerful pre-Columbian civilization. Strategize, accrue wealth, gain the favour of the gods, and become the builder of the magnificent Pyramid of the Sun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Teotihuacan: City of Gods, each player commands a force of worker dice, which grow in strength with every move. On your turn, you move a worker around a modular board, always choosing one of two areas of the location tile you land on: one offering you an action (and a worker upgrade), the other providing you with a powerful bonus (but without an upgrade).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While managing their workforce and resources, players develop new technologies, climb the steps of the three great temples, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, and raise the legendary and breath-taking Pyramid of the Sun in the centre of the city.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game is played in three eras. As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times. The player with the most fame is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&amp;#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&amp;#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&amp;#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&amp;#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&amp;#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&amp;#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&amp;#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&amp;#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&amp;#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game.

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &amp;quot;later&amp;quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &amp;ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear. There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

New Characters include Elrond, Galadriel, Sm&amp;eacute;agol, Gothmog, and the powerful Balrog of Moria, as well as alternate versions of Gandalf, the Witch-king, and the Mouth of Sauron.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New special Action Dice are included: Elven Ring Keepers dice for the Free Peoples player and Lesser Minion dice for the Shadow player. New versions of all the Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring are also included, to play the optional &amp;quot;Council of Rivendell&amp;quot; rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As an added bonus, figures for Aragorn and Gandalf the White are provided, accessories to the game that fans have been eagerly awaiting!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Build your warband, construct your deck, and defeat your rivals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shadespire was once a city of wonder and magic, a mercantile metropolis whose rulers defied death, to the fury of Nagash. During the height of the city&amp;rsquo;s powers, rivals, thieves and would-be conquerors were locked away in the sprawling dungeon known as the Nightvault. After the city&amp;rsquo;s fall, Nagash broke open the chains that bound the shackled spirits within, giving them weapons to freeze the hearts of the living and enough memory of their torment to fill them with hatred and jealousy. The spectral dead delight in the chance to inflict this hatred upon the living, and the streets of Shadespire echo to the sounds of terrifying screams and cruel, mocking laughter...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband &amp;ndash; 2 are included in this box &amp;ndash; and build a deck of power and objective cards. After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions &amp;ndash; movement and attacks &amp;ndash; until 3 phases are played. Between actions, you can use the power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe. Merely vanquishing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s warband does not guarantee victory &amp;ndash; capturing objectives, standing your ground, making the best tactical choices and deploying the right cards at the right time will gain you the glory points you need to win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the rules, games will take around 30 minutes &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ll always have time for a rematch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In The Box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everything you and a friend need to play games of Warhammer Underworlds is included in this box. Contained within:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     A Stormcast Eternals warband &amp;ndash; Stormsire&amp;rsquo;s Cursebreakers &amp;ndash; made up of 3 push-fit, blue plastic miniatures (Rastus the Charmed, Ammis Dawnguard and the leader, Averon Stormsire);&amp;#10;     A Nighthaunt warband &amp;ndash; the Thorns of the Briarqueen &amp;ndash; made up of 7 push-fit, bone-coloured plastic miniatures (The Ever-Hanged, Varclav the Cruel, the leader Briar Queen and 4 Chainrasps whom Nagash has not afforded the dignity of names). Both of these warbands are Easy To Build, with no glue necessary and a comprehensive, easy to follow construction guide;&amp;#10;     A 32-page rulebook, including the story of Shadespire&amp;rsquo;s rise and fall, the opening of the Nightvault, the background of the 2 included warbands and all the rules you need to play &amp;ndash; including new scatter mechanics, rules for resolving magic spells, and the use of lethal hexes, sections of game board that are fatal to those pushed in;&amp;#10;     An 8-page quick start guide, covering the contents of the box, understanding your cards, movement and attacks, and playing your first game;&amp;#10;     2 double-sided game boards, featuring hexes and objectives;&amp;#10;     2 pre-built decks of power and objective cards &amp;ndash; 96 in total &amp;ndash; for use with the included warbands;&amp;#10;     10 double-sided Fighter cards, providing the stats and information needed for the fighters in each warband at a glance;&amp;#10;     5 attack dice, 3 defence dice and 3 magic dice;&amp;#10;     11 double-sided objective tokens;&amp;#10;     A scatter template;&amp;#10;     30 wound tokens;&amp;#10;     46 double-sided glory point tokens;&amp;#10;     15 double-sided move and charge tokens;&amp;#10;     15 Guard tokens;&amp;#10;     8 activation counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Extra Rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Warhammer Underworlds has an intense, fast and fun core ruleset, but the book contains a host of extras - new game modes, competitive and multiplayer rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Matched Play: designed for competitive play, this is a set of rules that level the playing field to the finest degree &amp;ndash; perfect for fast, friendly rivalries and tournaments;&amp;#10;     Multiplayer games: extra rules that allow you to combine 2 core sets of Warhammer Underworlds to create 3-or-4-player games, with clarified rules for resolving attacks and adjustments to victory conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also included is a glossary for quick and easy reference and a sample chapter of The Mirrored City, a Black Library novel set in Shadespire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because of the communal actions, game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players. With many varying strategies and completely randomized action sets, no two games will feel the same!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &amp;mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&amp;rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&amp;rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Our longest was about 18 hours (our shortest around 12). But a game is always an event and I have not yet had a player at the table who regretted joining. \\n\\nVery important that everyone has read/watched the rules before joining their first time. It is an absolute pain to teach and takes important time from actually playing the game, which is long enough already.</comment>\\t\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item objecttype=\"thing\"

The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players\\' followers.

The game is over when the Pharoah\\'s Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don\\'t use during the course of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<yearpublished value=\"1992\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<minplayers value=\"2\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<maxplayers value=\"4\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t<poll name=\"suggested_numplayers\" title=\"User Suggested Number of Players\" totalvotes=\"9\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results numplayers=\"1\">\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Best\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Recommended\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Not Recommended\" numvotes=\"4\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results numplayers=\"2\">\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Best\" numvotes=\"1\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Recommended\" numvotes=\"3\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Not Recommended\" numvotes=\"2\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results numplayers=\"3\">\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Best\" numvotes=\"6\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Recommended\" numvotes=\"2\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Not Recommended\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results numplayers=\"4\">\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Best\" numvotes=\"4\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Recommended\" numvotes=\"4\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Not Recommended\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results numplayers=\"4+\">\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Best\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Recommended\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"Not Recommended\" numvotes=\"3\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t</poll> \\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<playingtime value=\"60\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<minplaytime value=\"60\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<maxplaytime value=\"60\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t               \\t\\t\\t\\t<minage value=\"12\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t<poll name=\"suggested_playerage\" title=\"User Suggested Player Age\" totalvotes=\"2\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<results>\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"2\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"3\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"4\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"5\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"6\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"8\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"10\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"12\" numvotes=\"1\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"14\" numvotes=\"1\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"16\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"18\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result value=\"21 and up\" numvotes=\"0\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</results>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t</poll> \\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t\\t<poll name=\"language_dependence\" title=\"Language Dependence\" totalvotes=\"3\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<results>\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result level=\"11\" value=\"No necessary in-game text\" numvotes=\"3\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<result level=\"12\" value=\"Some necessary text -

The first part of the game involves constructing the game board, after which players take turns using cards to determine how many new people should appear and what type of terrain they will inhabit.  All tribes start off as barbarians, but soon the calming effect of civilization settles the marauding bands; although civilized tribes score more, they can no longer attack.  What they can do, though, is civilize other players\\' followers.

      "description You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description When Scrabble was introduced in Sweden in the mid-1950s, it was translated as Alfapet, and sold under that name for decades. In the early 1990's, the rights to the game reverted to the original publisher for some reason, but the rights to the name Alfapet stayed with BRIO.&#10;&#10;BRIO had purchased Alga some 10 years before and had made them BRIO's board game arm, phasing out the old board game brand Joker who had been used for all the Scrabble-Alfapets over the year. So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear's (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel (all subsequent editions in Swedish) started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name. It might be interesting to note that Joker's last Alfapet (of Scrabble type) and Spear's first was virtually identical to each other, save some names and logotypes.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Joker's last edition of Scrabble&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;  &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Spear's first and only edition&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9; &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Alga's first edition of &quot;new&quot; Alfapet&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;The name Alfapet was much more known, so this game sold better (most people who had heard of &quot;Scrabble&quot; thought it to be the English version of &quot;Alfapet&quot;).&#10;&#10;To a large extent, Alfapet and Scrabble are very similar games. The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.&#10;&#10;To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition. The only known difference in this limited edition is that it has a new dark design.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Scrabble&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&#10;&#10;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description &quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL&quot;&#10;&#10;In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan&rsquo;s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

This clan comes complete with 8 Warrior figures (in two different sculpts), 1 Leader Figure, 1 Ship figure, 1 Clan Sheet, 1 Plastic Glory Marker, 4 cardboard Clan tokens, 11 small colored bases, and 2 large colored bases.&#10;&#10;This expansion introduces the option of playing Blood Rage with 5 players. The game board supports this by simply not having any province destroyed by Ragnar&ouml;k before the beginning of the game. However, more players need more cards, so this expansion box comes with 24 &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; cards (8 for each Age deck). All of these cards have the &quot;5+&quot; players pre-requisite listed on them. While most of them are extra copies of cards from the base game, there are a few new ones, like the &quot;Widespread!&quot; Quest, where you need to dominate any 2 provinces.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The Gods of &Aacute;sgard expansion:&#10;&#10;Only two gods will be part of each game session. Randomly draw two god cards and place them next to the board so all players can see their powers. At the end of the initial setup, shuffle the Ragnar&ouml;k tokens that are not on the board or on the Age Track and draw two of them. Look at the names of the two provinces listed on the tokens and place one god figure in each of them (these Ragnar&ouml;k tokens are then put aside).&#10;&#10;Each god's ability is always in effect, changing the rules of the province they're in. The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnar&ouml;k tokens.&#10;&#10;The combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will you try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans. They add a whole new layer to the game, without adding hardly any complexity to the rules.&#10;&#10;The miniatures each come with a tarot-sized God card.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&#10;&#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&#10;&#10;New &quot;Sell&quot; system&#10;&#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&#10;&#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&#10;&#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&#10;&#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&#10;&#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&#10;&#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&#10;&#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.&#10;&#10;Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Beschreibung&#10;&#10;Eine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St&auml;dten und Kl&ouml;stern, Stra&szlig;en und Wiesen.

Und das mit wachsender Begeisterung!&#10;Carcassonne ist ein Legespiel, bei dem die Spieler verdeckt Landschaftspl&auml;ttchen ziehen und an die bestehende Landschaft passend anlegen m&uuml;ssen. Auf den Pl&auml;ttchen sind St&auml;dte, Stra&szlig;en, Kl&ouml;ster und Grasland in verschiedenen Kombinationen dargestellt. Wenn dann das Pl&auml;ttchen passend angelegt wurde, darf der Spieler entscheiden, ob auf das gerade angelegte Pl&auml;ttchen ein Meeple als Ritter (in Stadt), Wegelagerer (auf Stra&szlig;e), M&ouml;nch (in Kloster) oder Bauer (auf Wiese) eingesetzt werden soll, vor allem wenn es vielleicht gerade der letzte ist...&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The Tower is the fourth major expansion for the Carcassonne game.  Tower segments are added to the game, as well as some new actions.  Instead of placing a Meeple as usual on their turns, players can now either place a tower segment on a tile with a space for a tower, add a tower segment to a tower already standing, or place a Meeple on top of a tower (which &quot;finishes&quot; it).&#10;&#10;Placing a tower segment allows you to capture other players' Meeples, so long as they are in view of the tower in an orthogonal direction.  If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:&#10;&#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.&#10;&#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)&#10;&#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description This is an expansion for The Settlers of Catan. Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.&#10;&#10;Part of the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;This game requires The Settlers of Catan.  Ideally, using the same publisher and edition of the game.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.  Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.  This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more.&#10;&#10;In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense.  The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.  The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot.&#10;&#10;With danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you'll need every advantage you can take...&#10;&#10;Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil.&#10;&#10;Compared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Simpler rules for determining line of sight &#10;     Faster setup of each encounter&#10;     Defense dice to mitigate the tendency to &quot;math out&quot; attacks&#10;     Shorter quests with plenty of natural stopping points&#10;     Cards that list necessary statistics, conditions, and effects&#10;     A new mechanism for controlling the overlord powers&#10;     Enhanced hero selection and creation process&#10;     Experience system to allow for hero growth and development&#10;     Out-of-the-box campaign system&#10;&#10;&#10; Descent 1st edition Conversion Kit &#10;&#10;&#10;     Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; Conversion Kit&#10;&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description &quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&mdash;leading to immense variety.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The 2nd edition of the classic adventure game Drakborgen (DungeonQuest) from 1985. The players enter the unexplored Dragon's Keep in search for treasure. The Keep is home to a dragon, and it is up to the players, with luck and timing, to overcome the dangers, collect some treasure and escape from the Keep before the sun sets and the vampires go hunting.&#10;&#10;This edition features streamlined rules, for example pre-placed one-use event tiles (placed onto the room tiles) instead of the players drawing room cards each time they enter a room. Door cards, trap cards, search cards, corpse cards and chest cards have been rationalized; all is now contained on the room tiles. Undefeated monsters and certain traps now stay on the board, and the game features a slightly more complex and tactical fighting system. The game allows for co-operative play, and even the dragon herself can be killed.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    DungeonQuest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.&#10;&#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&#10;&#10;Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Epic is a fantasy card game by White Wizard Games which aims to recreate the TCG-style experience from a single box, with no additional purchases required.&#10;&#10;Epic is a card game designed to start quickly but also to reward deep, strategic plays. In Epic, you take on the role of an elder god, in conflict with other elder gods. The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm.   In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards &ndash; each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn &mdash; you don&rsquo;t need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play.&#10;&#10;Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &quot;token&quot; champions. One box supports preconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &quot;cube&quot; environment for drafting.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&#10;&#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!&#10;&#10;Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back?

      "description The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &mdash; or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources&#10;     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities&#10;     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units&#10;     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "name None None primary Formula D\n",
      "description Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters &mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?&#10;&#10;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &mdash; i.e., learning the game &mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train. This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the &quot;Great Western Trail&quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&#10;&#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;The first edition of Great Western Trail was released with a player count of 2-4, with some people making solo rules on their own, while the second edition will include solitaire rules, making for a player count of 1-4.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Hannibal &amp; Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage is a 20th anniversary edition of the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, an asymmetrical card-driven game for 2 players set in the time of the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal was designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. Hannibal has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com&rsquo;s Wargame rankings.&#10;&#10;The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz. The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It has received new artwork. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure. These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be available as a separate products. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the Hannibal map on one side and the Hamilcar map on the other).&#10;&#10;Hamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world&rsquo;s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.&#10;&#10;In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Settlers from four major powers of the world have discovered new lands, with new resources and opportunities. Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...&#10;&#10;Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the &quot;insider&quot; who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the &quot;master&quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &quot;insider&quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &quot;commons&quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider. If they guess correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen&mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!&#10;&#10;Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet&rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.&#10;&#10;This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!&#10;&#10;Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them&mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival&rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.&#10;&#10;The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&#10;&#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.&#10;&#10;Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition&#10;&#10;A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001. The Limited Edition has a silver 22 carat gold plated ring, pewter Hobbit playing pieces, and a signed and numbered John Howe print. Box signed by Reiner Knizia.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Welcome to the city of Machi Koro. You've just been elected Mayor. Congrats! Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.&#10;&#10;Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!&#10;&#10;Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description &#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a fully co-operative, app-driven board game of horror and mystery for one to five players that takes place in the same universe as Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign. Let the immersive app guide you through the veiled streets of Innsmouth and the haunted corridors of Arkham's cursed mansions as you search for answers and respite. Eight brave investigators stand ready to confront four scenarios of fear and mystery, collecting weapons, tools, and information, solving complex puzzles, and fighting monsters, insanity, and death. Open the door and step inside these hair-raising Mansions of Madness: Second Edition. It will take more than just survival to conquer the evils terrorizing this town.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Publisher's Description&#10;&#10;Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Other&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;&#10;&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

Created by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic... 112 more cards for the game of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Play a new race: Orcs! Face foes like the Hydrant and the Tentacle Demons. Equip yourself with dread armor like the Spiked Codpiece. Recruit allies like the Shoulder Dragon. Wield mighty weapons like Druid Fluid, the Catapult and, of course, the dread Unnatural Axe... and show them who's the greatest munchkin of all.&#10;&#10;Munchkin 2 - Unnatural Axe is a supplement to Munchkin; you will need the original game to play. Or you could add it to a game of Munchkin, Munchkin Fu, or Munchkin Bites! instead, or mix them all together for a Munchkin-fest of truly mind-bending proportions!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Other&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel&#10;&#10;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.&#10;&#10;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description During the medieval goings-on around Orl&eacute;ans, you must assemble a following of farmers, merchants, knights, monks, etc. to gain supremacy through trade, construction and science in medieval France.&#10;&#10;In the city of Orl&eacute;ans and the area of the Loire, you can take trade trips to other cities to acquire coveted goods and build trading posts. You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate.&#10;&#10;In Orl&eacute;ans, you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough.&#10;&#10;For three generations, we, the last fragments of humanity have lived on the seas, on floating stations called &quot;havens.&quot; Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely.&#10;&#10;We've managed to keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off our grid...&#10;&#10;Tomorrow, a small group of us head out into what's left of the world. We don't know what we'll find.&#10;&#10;Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 is an epic cooperative game for 2 to 4 players. Unlike most other games, this one is working against you. What's more, some of the actions you take in Pandemic Legacy will carry over to future games. No two worlds will ever be alike!&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice. Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:&#10;&#10;&#10;    All numbers in a row must increase from left to right.&#10;    No number can be repeated in a vertical column.&#10;&#10;&#10;A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet.&#10;&#10;The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows. Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon. For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row. For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row. For each misthrow, a player loses five points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description 2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&#10;&#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a game created by Ignacy Trzewiczek, the author of Stronghold. This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal. You will build a shelter, palisade, weapons, you will create tools like axes, knives, sacks, you will do everything you can to&hellip; to survive. You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes&hellip;&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make.&#10;&#10;Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who&rsquo;s stuck on rock island&hellip;&#10;&#10;Let the adventure live!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness.&#10;&#10;The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.&#10;&#10;Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.&#10;&#10;The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.&#10;&#10;The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.&#10;&#10;The Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.&#10;&#10;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&#10;&#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Monkey Business&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&mdash;all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.&#10;&#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

We think you may be able to help us.&quot;&#10;     &ndash;Mon Mothma&#10;&#10;New leaders. New missions. New tactic cards that lead to more fully cinematic combats&hellip; Rise of the Empire is an expansion for Star Wars: Rebellion inspired largely by the movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And just as the movie provided new insight into the Galactic Civil War presented in the original Star Wars trilogy, Rise of the Empire adds new depth and story to your Rebellion game experience.&#10;&#10;You can send Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor to recover the Death Star plans. You can confuse Imperials with false orders and assaults behind enemy lines. You can command Director Krennic and his finest death troopers. And you can set traps for the Rebel pilots and soldiers, luring them away from their base and into massive battles with more fully cinematic combat and tactics. Even Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, offering his services to the Empire and feeding his prisoners to the Sarlaac.&#10;&#10;Altogether, Rise of the Empire introduces eight new leaders, thirty-six plastic miniatures, five target markers, two attachment rings, three new dice, and more than one-hundred new cards. You'll find U-wings, TIE Strikers, Nebulon-B frigates, and the Interdictor. You'll gain new ways of subverting your opponent's plans, and you'll discover a whole new chapter in your ongoing Galactic Civil War!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

To attain this lofty position, players must leave Terra and the known planets to explore and colonize the galaxy, while working to establish trade with alien cultures, encounter aliens, and defeat pirates. Glory and victory go to the brave and astute explorer upon whom luck smiles.&#10;&#10;The known worlds lie at one end of the game board, where each of the 3 or 4 players begins from known solar systems, each with 3 planets producing raw materials needed for the travels into deep space.&#10;&#10;Each player begins with 2 Colonies and a Space Port (all components are made from plastic). The Space Port makes starships to transport your new colonies and trade posts to distant lands. Throughout the game, all the colonies and spaceports enable the production of resources when the dice match the numbers of adjacent planets. Resources are traded for colony ships, trade ships, and fleet upgrades of freight rings, booster rockets, and cannon. Beware as you explore&mdash;some planets are covered in ice, and some conceal dangerous pirates.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Expansions were published in this order:&#10;&#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &#226;&#128;&#147; Endurance (2017) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)&#10;&#10;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times.

      "description In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.&#10;&#10;Terra Mystica is a full information game without any luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&#10;&#10;&#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.&#10;&#10;Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.&#10;&#10;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.&#10;&#10;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Ticket to Ride: London features the familiar gameplay from the Ticket to Ride game series &mdash; collect cards, claim routes, draw tickets &mdash; but on a scaled-down map of 1970s London that allows you to complete a game in no more than 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a supply of 17 double-decker buses, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two destination tickets that show locations in London. On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear. There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault is an action-packed combat game for two players. Build your warband, construct your deck, and defeat your rivals.&#10;&#10;Shadespire was once a city of wonder and magic, a mercantile metropolis whose rulers defied death, to the fury of Nagash. During the height of the city&rsquo;s powers, rivals, thieves and would-be conquerors were locked away in the sprawling dungeon known as the Nightvault. After the city&rsquo;s fall, Nagash broke open the chains that bound the shackled spirits within, giving them weapons to freeze the hearts of the living and enough memory of their torment to fill them with hatred and jealousy. The spectral dead delight in the chance to inflict this hatred upon the living, and the streets of Shadespire echo to the sounds of terrifying screams and cruel, mocking laughter...&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband &ndash; 2 are included in this box &ndash; and build a deck of power and objective cards. After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions &ndash; movement and attacks &ndash; until 3 phases are played. Between actions, you can use the power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe. Merely vanquishing your opponent&rsquo;s warband does not guarantee victory &ndash; capturing objectives, standing your ground, making the best tactical choices and deploying the right cards at the right time will gain you the glory points you need to win!&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;re familiar with the rules, games will take around 30 minutes &ndash; you&rsquo;ll always have time for a rematch.&#10;&#10;In The Box&#10;&#10;Everything you and a friend need to play games of Warhammer Underworlds is included in this box. Contained within:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Stormcast Eternals warband &ndash; Stormsire&rsquo;s Cursebreakers &ndash; made up of 3 push-fit, blue plastic miniatures (Rastus the Charmed, Ammis Dawnguard and the leader, Averon Stormsire);&#10;     A Nighthaunt warband &ndash; the Thorns of the Briarqueen &ndash; made up of 7 push-fit, bone-coloured plastic miniatures (The Ever-Hanged, Varclav the Cruel, the leader Briar Queen and 4 Chainrasps whom Nagash has not afforded the dignity of names). Both of these warbands are Easy To Build, with no glue necessary and a comprehensive, easy to follow construction guide;&#10;     A 32-page rulebook, including the story of Shadespire&rsquo;s rise and fall, the opening of the Nightvault, the background of the 2 included warbands and all the rules you need to play &ndash; including new scatter mechanics, rules for resolving magic spells, and the use of lethal hexes, sections of game board that are fatal to those pushed in;&#10;     An 8-page quick start guide, covering the contents of the box, understanding your cards, movement and attacks, and playing your first game;&#10;     2 double-sided game boards, featuring hexes and objectives;&#10;     2 pre-built decks of power and objective cards &ndash; 96 in total &ndash; for use with the included warbands;&#10;     10 double-sided Fighter cards, providing the stats and information needed for the fighters in each warband at a glance;&#10;     5 attack dice, 3 defence dice and 3 magic dice;&#10;     11 double-sided objective tokens;&#10;     A scatter template;&#10;     30 wound tokens;&#10;     46 double-sided glory point tokens;&#10;     15 double-sided move and charge tokens;&#10;     15 Guard tokens;&#10;     8 activation counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;Extra Rules&#10;&#10;Warhammer Underworlds has an intense, fast and fun core ruleset, but the book contains a host of extras - new game modes, competitive and multiplayer rules:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Matched Play: designed for competitive play, this is a set of rules that level the playing field to the finest degree &ndash; perfect for fast, friendly rivalries and tournaments;&#10;     Multiplayer games: extra rules that allow you to combine 2 core sets of Warhammer Underworlds to create 3-or-4-player games, with clarified rules for resolving attacks and adjustments to victory conditions.&#10;&#10;&#10;Also included is a glossary for quick and easy reference and a sample chapter of The Mirrored City, a Black Library novel set in Shadespire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals. There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!&#10;&#10;Because of the communal actions, game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players. With many varying strategies and completely randomized action sets, no two games will feel the same!&#10;&#10; None None None\n",

      "description Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10; None None None\n",
